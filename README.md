## Zoo and Animal Classes (Continued)

### Instruction 17

Your manager suggests modifying the "addAnimal" method to include the previously created "isZooFull()" method.

### Instruction 18

To protect the various characteristics of the created objects, your superior asks you to restrict access to the attributes of the "Animal" and "Zoo" classes, taking the following points into consideration:

- An animal cannot have a negative age.
- The name of a zoo must not be empty.

Fix these errors to ensure data integrity.

### Instruction 19

To organize your code, your manager requests that you use the packages "tn.esprit.gestionzoo.main" and "tn.esprit.gestionzoo.entities" for your classes.

These instructions will further refine your project and ensure code quality. Be sure to update your GitHub repository's README with these changes and any additional documentation required.
