## Zoo and Animal Classes (Continued)

### Instruction 14

Modify the "nbrCages" attribute in the "Zoo" class by making it a constant. Remember that a zoo can contain a maximum of 25 animals. Make the necessary changes in the constructor to accommodate this constant.

### Instruction 15

Create the method "boolean isZooFull()" in the "Zoo" class. This method checks if the zoo is full based on the number of animals and the number of cages.

### Instruction 16

Create a method "Zoo compareZoo(Zoo z1, Zoo z2)" in the "Zoo" class. This method takes two objects of type "Zoo" as parameters and returns the zoo with the most animals.

These additional instructions will further enhance the functionality of your zoo management system. Please document these changes and additions in your GitHub repository's README.
