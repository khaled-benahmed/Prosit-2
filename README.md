## Zoo and Animal Classes (Continued)

### Instruction 32

Modify the return type of the "addAnimal(Animal animal)" method from boolean to void and remove the tests that check whether the zoo is full.

### Instruction 33

Create your own exception class called "ZooFullException." The "addAnimal" method should now use this new exception. Correct the errors in the "main" method, keeping in mind that your program should always display the number of animals after each addition. Reduce the number of cages to 3 and test your code.

### Instruction 34

We want to disallow adding an animal with a negative age and should throw an exception. Create a class called "InvalidAgeException" to handle this exception. Correct the errors in the "main" method.
