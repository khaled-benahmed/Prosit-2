## Zoo and Animal Classes (Continued)

### Instruction 20

To simplify the management of animals in our zoos, we distinguish two main families of animals: Aquatic and Terrestrial.

- An aquatic animal is characterized by the "habitat" (String) attribute, indicating its living environment.
- A terrestrial animal is characterized by the "nbrLegs" (int) attribute, indicating the number of legs.

Additionally, an aquatic animal can be:

- A dolphin (Dolphin), characterized by the "swimmingSpeed" (float) attribute, indicating its swimming speed.
- A penguin (Penguin), characterized by the "swimmingDepth" (float) attribute, describing the depth it can swim underwater.

Create these classes by declaring only the attributes.

### Instruction 21

In the "main" method, create an instance of each class created previously using the default constructors.

### Instruction 22

Create parameterized constructors in the subclasses. Ensure to protect the previously declared attributes.

### Instruction 23

Override the "toString()" method in the three subclasses to include both common and specific attributes. In the "main" method, display the objects created earlier.

### Instruction 24

Create the "public void swim()" method in the following classes:

- "Aquatic," which displays the message: "This aquatic animal is swimming."
- "Dolphin," which displays the message: "This dolphin is swimming."

Call this method for three objects of types "Aquatic," "Dolphin," and "Penguin." Note your observations.
